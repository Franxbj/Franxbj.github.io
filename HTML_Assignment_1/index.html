      <em>How to Code a Sandcastle</em> <br /><br />
      Pearl wants to build the perfect sandcastle at the beach, but she needs
      help from her robot friend <span style="color: brown">Pascal</span>.
      Together, they learn how to break down the big task into smaller steps
      using coding concepts.

      <br /><br />
      When things don't go as planned, Pearl discovers the importance of
      debugging and trying again.
      <strong
        >She learns that making mistakes is part of the process and that
        perseverance is key to success.</strong
      >The story makes coding fun and accessible by connecting it to a familiar
      activity that all children understand.
